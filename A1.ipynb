        "•\tThis research paper has proposed a new method of fisher faces, a derivative of Fisher’s linear discriminant techniques to deal with the glitches of lighting variations, and facial expressions in the face images to a significant extent. The paper also has an inclusion of other face recognition algorithms and the proposed innovation method outcomes to tackle the limitations of the former ones and attain much lower error rates.\n",
